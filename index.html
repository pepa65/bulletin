<h4>Complete the Student Medical Information Form</h4>
All students must have an updated medical form on file. Please use this link to complete the Student Medical Information Form online before September 24 if you haven’t signed a paper version already for this school year. (This is not for KG) Thank you for helping us keep our students safe!
<h4>The Ebeling Family</h4>
Most of you are aware that the Ebelings continue pressing on through Covid illness and a required Bangkok hospital 30 day quarantine. Keep praying for complete health for Eric, Rutha, Jadon and Esther.

Also, some individuals created a GoFundMe campaign to help the Ebelings with the surprise costs encountered by this health emergency and extended hospital stay. Please consider sharing the GoFundMe link on your Facebook or Instagram account in order to spread word about this effort to help the Ebelings.
